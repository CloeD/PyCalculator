# PyCalculator

Project created for *[Les Scientifines](https://scientifines.com/en/)*, a nonprofit organisation based in Montreal, for kids to learn programming.

*[Mission](https://scientifines.com/en/mission-et-historique/)   -   [Impact](https://scientifines.com/en/limpact-des-scientifines/)  -  [Contact Les Scientifines](https://scientifines.com/en/nous-joindre/)*

## Objectives

This project is designed to introduce kids from **8 to 17 years old** to programming and its different aspects.

The *PyCalcolator* aims to be:
- Versatile
- Educational
- An introduction to different aspects of programming such as conditions, loops, oriented-object programming and understanding variables
- A sanbox

## How it works

Different branches aim to introduce to different subjects. Thus, the branch name must describe which method of the application will be recreated by the kids or what is the objective of the learning session. Sessions are usually around **1 hour long**, and can go up to **2 hours long**. Please remember this when proposing a new activity.

Each branch should contain a README explaining the objectives of the session, the flow of the activity, the difficulty of the activity and the target age. Hints can be given, but must be hidden in the README. 

The application **must** be working and operational, except for the educational part. For example, if you want an activity focused on the logic of calculating the equation, the method can simply return 1 when pressing on the equal button, thus showing that the equation is equal to one. 

## Download

Participants can simply **go to the branch of their choice** depending on which activity they want to focus on and **download a zip file of the code**. This process is simpler for kids to understand than introducing them to git and its commands.

## Contributions

Contributions are always welcomed, but please be aware this project was made for a nonprofit organisation (Les Scientifines) and that it can and will be reused for educational purposes by them.

Please check out [their website](https://scientifines.com/en/) and [their mission](https://scientifines.com/en/mission-et-historique/), and do not hesite to contact them if you'd like to create some fun activities in IT.

If you are close to Montreal (Quebec, Canada) and would like to do a donation of your old laptop, *Les Scientifines* would gladly accept it as they are always searching for ways to upgrade their old materials.
